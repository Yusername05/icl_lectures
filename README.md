### description
Lecture notes from all courses taken during 2023/24 entry Msci Mathematics at Imperial College London. Most of the clever formatting and latex was lifted from https://github.com/Multramate/IC-GANT. None of these notes are full copies of any official course material provided by imperial college london.
